## Short Description
Platform aiming to simplify securing developer contracts through implementing a bidding system.

## Background
Inspired by the Fiverr website, Deverr is a job hunting platform allowing Auctioneers to advertise contracts, which interested Developers(Bidders) can 'bid' on.

This is the third project in the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course. Working with two other colleagues, we had 10 days to develop a full stack MERN application using an Express API to serve data from a Mongo database, and a separate front-end built with React.
